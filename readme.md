## Processing and Visualising Data

Based on the provided and imported data, students learn methods and techniques for data
processing, such as extraction, aggregation, selection, grouping, combining, and indexing to
become familiar with technologies in use. Data manipulation will be performed using Python
Pandas. Next, the processed data will be presented in graphical form along with interactive data
visualization methods. Finally, the learned methods and techniques of data processing and
visualization will be compared with those available in Microsoft Excel. At the end of the
course, students will pursue their own project to process and visualise some real data.
